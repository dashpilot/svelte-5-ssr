# Svelte 5 Server-side rendering (SSR)

Simple example of how you can server-side-render a Svelte 5 component.

## How it works:

1. In order to SSR a Svelte component, you first need to compile it into a .js file, so Node.js can work with it
2. After that, you import the precompiled file, and render it

## How to run

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the script:

```bash
npm run build
```
